<h3>What is a bike RWC safety certificate?</h3>

<p>A roadworthy safety certificate (or RWC) is required in most Australian states and territories before a vehicle can be sold or re-registered. <space/> The inspection covers various aspects of your motorcycle, such as brakes, tyres, suspension, steering, lights, and more. <space/> The goal of the bike inspection is to ensure that your bike meets the minimum safety standards required to be ridden on public roads.</p>


<h3>What if the bike fails the inspection?</h3>
<p>The first thing is – don't worry. <space/> This can happen from time to time – and we are here to guide you through the process.  We will explain exactly what needs to be done to bring the motorcycle into compliance.  Sometimes these items are quite small and quickly resolved.  You have 14 days to rectify the issues – then simply call us back for a re-inspection so we can verify that the issues have been addressed.   We will then issue you with your bike roadworthy certificate.</p>

<p>Getting a car roadworthy safety certificate is not only a legal requirement but also ensures the safety of you and other road users. Riding an unroadworthy bike can result in fines, demerit points, and even accidents that could cause serious injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>If you're planning to sell your bike, having a bike roadworthy safety certificate can also increase its value and make it more attractive to potential buyers. Buyers are more likely to trust a seller who can provide proof that the bike has been inspected and is roadworthy.</p>
