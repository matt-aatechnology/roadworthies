<h3>What is a vehicle safety certificate?</h3>

<p>A car roadworthy safety certificate is required in most Australian states and territories before a vehicle can be sold or re-registered. The inspection covers various aspects of your car, such as brakes, tyres, suspension, steering, lights, and more. The goal of the inspection is to ensure that your car meets the minimum safety standards required to be driven on public roads.</p>


<h3>What if the car fails the inspection?</h3>
<p>The first thing is – don't worry.  This can happen from time to time – and we are here to guide you through the process.  We will explain exactly what needs to be done to bring the vehicle into compliance.  Sometimes these items are quite small and quickly resolved.  You have 14 days to rectify the issues – then simply call us back for a re-inspection so we can verify that the issues have been addressed.   We will then issue you with your vehicle roadworthy certificate.</p>




<h3>Book online now - We'll come to you</h3>

<p>We come to you to provide an onsite car roadworthy safety certificate so you can get your car on the road fast, or add value to your used car sale.</p>

<p>Getting a car roadworthy safety certificate is not only a legal requirement but also ensures the safety of you and other road users. Driving an unroadworthy vehicle can result in fines, demerit points, and even accidents that could cause serious injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>If you're planning to sell your car, having a car roadworthy safety certificate can also increase its value and make it more attractive to potential buyers. Buyers are more likely to trust a seller who can provide proof that the vehicle has been inspected and is roadworthy.</p>
